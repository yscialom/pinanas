Who are we?
-----------

PiNanas was born in 2020 during the Covid Pandemic when two friends discussed their frustrations around attempts to
setup Plex in a controlled environment, on low-cost hardware (Raspberry Pi 3).

It was around this time that [Techno Tim](https://www.technotim.live "Techno Tim homepage") published [a video on
Youtube](https://youtu.be/liV3c9m_OX8 "Put Wildcard Certificates and SSL on EVERYTHING - Traefik Tutorial") on how to
setup Traefik on a homelab, the first of a series on homelab services. These videos have been a continuous source of
inspiration for us. What we tinkered with became its own thing, and The Wife named it PiNanas: a
[NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage "Network-attached storage") on a
[Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/ "Raspberry Pi")!

We'd be sincerly pleased to see you finding interest in our toy project.
